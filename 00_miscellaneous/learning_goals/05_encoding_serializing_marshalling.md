### Encoding
Encoding is converting data from one form to another. Often from a human readable format to a more machine readable format. The purpose can also be to mask data. 

### Serializing
Serialization is the process of converting an object's state to a byte stream, so it can be stored or transmitted and reconstructed later. 

### Marshalling
Marshalling is a form of serialization where a language specific object's state is serialized. Therefore marshalling will typically not work across different languages (?).

### Charsets
**ASCII**: Contains 128 characters covering English letters, numerals, and basic punctuation.

**Unicode**: A computing industry standard designed to consistently encode, represent and handle text expressed in most of the world's writing systems.

### Encoding Types
**UTF-8**: A popular encoding method for Unicode that is backward compatible with ASCII.

**UTF-16**: Another method for encoding Unicode characters, often used for languages that require more characters than can be represented in a single byte.

**Base64**: Represents binary data in an ASCII string format
